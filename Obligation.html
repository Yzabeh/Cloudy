    <h1>HER OBLIGATION</h1>
    <pre>
	<br>HER OBLIGATION</br>
        <br>I felt my mother's care and love when I was just five years old. 
        I will never forget those memories, because at that time, 
        it was the happiest day that had happened in my entire life. 
        But everything changed when the police arrested my father for no apparent reason. 
        Since that day, I have also noticed that mama has changed, 
        she has gone crazy and she almost doesn’t want to let go of the doll she's holding. 
        She's always stupid and gets angry whenever someone touches her doll. 
        I found out everything when I was eight years old. 
        I found out that my father was addicted to drugs, so the police arrested him.
        Our neighbor said that my mother was also addicted to drugs 
        and that my father covered it up so that she wouldn't be imprisoned. 
        We were three siblings but I couldn’t understand that 
        even though our mother let us down and chose drugs over us, 
        they still chose to be good to our mother and take care of her. 
        They still love mother without any anger but me, I love her but I hate her. 
        Because she chose drugs over her obligations. My mother lost her sanity because of illicit drugs. 
        While I walk home, I envy what I see. I envy my peers who happily give a gift to their mother on this mother’s day. 
        When I got home, I caught up with my siblings who were happily celebrating mother’s day. 
        They give a gift to mama, while mama looks like a child while hugging the doll. 
       "Eunelene, nandito kana pala halika batiin mo si mama," my sister said. 
        But instead of listening to her I rolled my eyes and i was about to enter my room 
        when suddenly I heard my mother voice. "Eu anak, 
        masaya ang mama ngayon dahil nakasama kita at ang mga kapatid mo," she uttered. 
        My heartbeat quickened at what she said and I turned to her. 
        I trembled at what I saw, not with joy but with anger and envy. 
        "How did you manage to call my name on that doll!" I shouted angrily at her while I clenched my fists. 
        "Ikaw Eunelene, anong karapatan mo para sigawan si mama?" my brother replied. 
        "May karapatan ako dahil hinayaan niya tayo! Hinayaan niya ako! 
       Para lang sa lentek na druga na 'yan! Iniwan niya ang mga obligasyon niya, kuya! Kaya ikaw ate, 
       bakit ko siya babatiin na hindi naman siya nagpaka-ina sa akin!" I shouted while my tears flowed.
      "P-paano mo nasabi 'yan, wala kang alam..." my sister said softly and cried to sit on the floor.
      "Anong walang alam!" I shouted. "Wala kang alam Eunelene! Wala kang alam na pinoprotektahan ka lang ni mama kay papa!
      " Because of what my brother said I stopped crying and looked at him. 
      "A-anong p-pinagsasabi mo?" I asked. "Oo gumagamit ng droga si mama hindi dahil gusto niya kundi upang protektahan ka.
      Ibebenta ka sana ni papa sa kakilala niyang nasa sindekato, Eunelene.
      Kapalit ng kaligtasan mo pinili ni mama na samahan sa mga masasamang gawain niya,
      lahat ng gusto ni papa sinusunod niya at kasama na doon ang pagpapagamit niya ng drugs kay mama.
      Pero sa kasamaang palad hindi kinaya ni mama ang epekto ng drugs sa katawan niya kaya nawala siya sa kanyang katinuan.
      Matagal na siyang nagpaka-ina sa iyo Eunelene," my sister uttered. My tears flowed at what I heard and I knelt on the floor.
     Buong buhay akong nagalit sa aking ina na wala naman talagang kasalanang ginawa.
     She didn't escape her obligation to me, she faced it in exchange for her own life I got up on my knees and without any doubt I hugged mama tightly.
    "I'm sorry, Happy mother's day, ma. I love you so much and thank you," I whispered.
     MOTHER, the only women whose sacrifices are bigger than her expectations, 
     but still dreams for her child SUCCESS, HAPPINESS and SAFETY.</br>
